# TSAI-Assignment-9

This repository has the code to implement ResNet50 from Scratch. The main objective is to minimize training time meanwhile preserving benchmark performance. A sample of the ImageNet 1k dataset was used to train the model. 

#### What has been done till now?
1. Implement a basic architecture of ResNet50
2. Add SGD Optimizer and custom Scheduler for faster and effective training

#### Next Steps
1. Add Squeeze and Excitation channels
2. Add dropout layers
3. Replace Max Pool with Average Pooling
